# Introduction #

The OptFlow package contains a C++-based library and testing suite for motion detection,
extrapolation and morphing algorithms. The currently implemented motion detection algorithms are applicable to two consecutive grayscale images. These motion fields can be used for extrapolating image sequences or interpolating between two images.

See the wiki pages for installation instructions and examples.

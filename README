This package contains a library and testing suite for motion detection, 
extrapolation and morphing algorithms. 

The motion detection algorithms included in this package are:
  * Lucas & Kanade local least-squares algorithm
  * Proesmans et. al. global anisotropic diffusion algorithm
  * Lucas & Kanade algorithm (OpenCV implementation)

The first two algorithms are implemented by the author of this package. 
They generate dense vector fields, i.e. motion vectors for 
each pixel in the source image. On the other hand, the OpenCV 
implementation generates sparse motion fields. It extracts 
the motion of a given set of "feature points". All algorithms 
in this package use image pyramids.

This package also contains algorithms for image warping by using 
a motion field. The following methods are implemented:
  * Inverse pixel-based extrapolation: For each pixel in the second source 
    image, find the corresponding pixel in the first source image. Requires 
    the inverse motion field (I2->I1).
  * Forward mesh extrapolation: construct a textured triangle mesh from the 
    image and transform the mesh by using the forward motion field (I1->I2).

The third feature implemented in this package is morphing between two 
images. In addition to cross-fading between images, the algorithm 
uses the forward and inverse motion fields to warp the images 
closer to each other before interpolating pixel values linearly. 
This technique yields much better results than simple cross-fading.

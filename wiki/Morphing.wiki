#summary Running morphing algorithms

= Morphing between two images =

The third feature implemented in OptFlow is morphing between two 
images. In addition to cross-fading between images, the algorithm 
uses the forward and inverse motion fields to warp the images 
closer to each other before interpolating pixel values linearly. 
This technique yields much better results than simple cross-fading.

*Installation:*

OptFlow uses CMake as its build system. To compile (and install) the package, type the following commands:

{{{
  cmake . <optional flags>   <- put your CMake flags here
  make
  sudo make install
}}}

Also make sure that you have recent versions of CMake and C++ compilers installed. OptFlow has been tested to compile with CMake >=2.6 and g++ >= 4.2. The last step is optional. You can also use the compiled files in the build directory.
